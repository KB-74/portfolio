The personal portfolio's are assessed individually. The contents of your personal portfolio should reflect your contribution to the project, your abilities and what you have learned. Your portfolio should consist of materials that you either realized individually, or in case of a group effort, a clear statement of what your contribution is in this group effort.

It is important to write your (digital) portfolio in a very easily accessible way. The main document should be like a reader's guide that shortly introduces your contributions and links to pages where the contributions are described in detail. Every contribution should be accessible from the reader's guide in a single click. We are not going to browse the folder, so if you do not link to a document from the reader's guide, we will not include it in the assessment.

For us, it is perfectly acceptable if you write down your portfolio in Github using Markdown, no need to do fancy markups.

Include information of the following subjects:

Courses (add screenshots of the online courses you have finished (DataCamp, Coursera, etc))
Domain Knowledge (Literature, jargon, evaluation, existing data sets, ...)
Predictive Models
Data preparation
Data Visualization
Data collection
Evaluation
Diagnostics of the learning process
Communication (presentations, summaries, paper, ...)
Link to the Python Notebooks you have finished (you can dump them to PDF)
List the tickets from the Scrum backlog that you worked on, linked to deliverables, own experiments, etc.
Add any other assignment you feel is evidence of your abilities
Deadline

Submit your portfolio by the end of week 17.

Feedback moments
We will organize a few feedback moments before the final assessment to make you aware of how your portfolio may be improved. We will announce these feedback moments. Meanwhile, we recommend to keep your portfolio up to date, to fully benefit form the opportunity to receive feedback.

##Introductie


##Courses
Voor deze minor heb ik al een stuk data-analyse uitgevoerd bij mijn bachelor technische natuurkunde. Deze kennis heb ik mede dankzij datacamp ruim uitgebreid. Ik heb de volgende courses in datacamp voltooid:
